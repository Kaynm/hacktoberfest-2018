# Hacktober 2018

# What is Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software, spearheaded by Digital Ocean, GitHub, and Twilio. Essentially itâ€™s a great way to contribute to open source software and give back to the coding community. You likely use open source software every day and may not even realize it. Hacktoberfest serves as both a celebration and a reminder and helps bring devs together to focus on working on improving open source software.
